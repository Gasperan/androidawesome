Development process:

For each hypothesis to be developed, create a new branch with a descriptive name. E.g.: scan-app-v1

1. Update your local master branch with the latest code in remote repository (go to your local master and do git pull origin master);
2. Checkout to a local branch with the name of the hypothesis (E.g.: scan-app-v1);
3. Start working in your changes;
-- CONSTANTLY TALK TO THE TEAM TO AVOID CONFLICTS --
4. Before pushing any code, update your local master branch and merge in your machine;
5. If everything is OK, git push origin scan-app-v1;
6. Check if your branch is ok in the remote repository (gitlab.nisumlatam.com).
